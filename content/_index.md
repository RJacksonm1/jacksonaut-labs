Hi, I'm Rob

My history is web dev, roughly categorised as:

- Video game wikis
- Small-med business sites (wide variety)
- Big-ish e-commerce companies
- Bicycle Sports ðŸš²

I don't have spare time. The following projects are things I've made in that lack of spare time.

Please be amazed if:

* Anything vaguely works
* Anything vaguely looks good
